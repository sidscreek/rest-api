we are designing a REST API - json

GET / users -> list all the users 
GET /api/users/1 - get the user with id 1
GET /api/users/2 - get the user with id 2
both 1 and 2 are dynamic paths paramenters 
GET /api/users/:id - get the user with id

:id -> variable 
POST /users - Create new user 
PATCH /users/2 - Edit the user with id: 1

DELETE /users/2 - delete the user with id:2

//we need data to perform all these 
 
how to do it ?
//frist import data (JSON file)
//once we get the data frontend will render it depending on the framework


for rest api 
we need /api/users

if GET /users -> render a html document 
if GET /api/users -> will return a JSON file 
basically it is a good practice to use all this 

so GET/users => GET/api/users

POST /users - Create new user 
now by default browser use GET request 


so for GET request its pretty standard 
but fot PATCH , POST and DELETE => we have to test them first for that we use POSTMAN 

why are we using postman ?

browsers only support GET requests , we need to test for other requests as well

POSTMAN is a platform to test your APIS , gives you all the required data 

Middleware : app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false}));
//this is our middleware/plugin
//jab bhi koi form data ayega yeh usko body mein daalne ka kaam karega 
//yeh plugin data ko uthayega and uska js object bana dega 
//like this 
// //Body [Object: null prototype] {
//     first_name: 'Siddhant ',
//     last_name: 'Jain',
//     email: 'siddhantjain027@gmail.com',
//     gender: 'male',
//     job_title: 'software dev'
//   }
  now our body has this data
now isko we can add in our mock data.json file
