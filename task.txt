we are designing a REST API - json

GET / users -> list all the users 
GET /api/users/1 - get the user with id 1
GET /api/users/2 - get the user with id 2
both 1 and 2 are dynamic paths paramenters 
GET /api/users/:id - get the user with id

:id -> variable 
POST /users - Create new user 
PATCH /users/2 - Edit the user with id: 1

DELETE /users/2 - delete the user with id:2

//we need data to perform all these 
 
how to do it ?
//frist import data (JSON file)
//once we get the data frontend will render it depending on the framework


for rest api 
we need /api/users

if GET /users -> render a html document 
if GET /api/users -> will return a JSON file 
basically it is a good practice to use all this 

so GET/users => GET/api/users
